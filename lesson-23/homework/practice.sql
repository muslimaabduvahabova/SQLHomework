from Dates

--Puzzle 2: In this puzzle you have to find out the unique Ids present in the table. You also have to find out the SUM of Max values of vals columns for each Id and RId. For more details please see the sample input and expected output.
select 
count(distinct id) as ID,
max(rID) as rID,
sum(MaxVals) as TotalOfMaxVals
from (
		select id, rID, 
		max(Vals) as MaxVals
	from MyTabel
	group by id, rID) as dt
;

--Puzzle 3: In this puzzle you have to get records with at least 6 characters and maximum 10 characters. Please see the sample input and expected output.
;
select Id, Vals
from TestFixLengths
where len(Vals) between 6 and 10
and Vals is not null
and vals <> '';

select t.ID, t.Item, t.Vals
from TestMaximum t
join ( 
	select id, max(vals) as MaxVals
	from TestMaximum
	group by id ) m
on t.ID = m.ID and t.Vals = m.MaxVals
;

--Puzzle 5: In this puzzle you have to first find the maximum value for each Id and DetailedNumber, and then Sum the data using Id only. Please check out sample input and expected output.
;
select ID, sum(DataValue) as SumofMax
from (
select DetailedNumber, max(Vals) as DataValue, Id 
from SumOfMax
group by DetailedNumber, Id) as dt
group by ID

--Puzzle 6: In this puzzle you have to find difference between a and b column between each row and if the difference is not equal to 0 then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. Now you need to replace this zero with blank.Please check the sample input and the expected output.
